	<p style="color:rgb(73, 251, 53);"> Along my research and observatory duty activities I have a great interest in the
    development of softwares using the Python language. Most of my research works come with software/module releases. I am 
    a great supporter of open-source and open-science and try to release as much as possible the tools I am using to do my 
    research.<br>
		You can find here the list of the tools I have developped and the link to their respective documentation.<br>
